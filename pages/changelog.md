title: Changelog
---

This changelog tries to be quite complete, and as such contains technical
details.

# 2024-01-08

This changelog entry is about an experimental subsection of Refli: Lex Iterata.

- [Lex Iterata](https://refli.be/fr/lex) is a novel rendition of some content
  of the Official Belgian Journal: the consolidated texts (Justel) as found
  through the ELI (European Legislation Identifier) indexes.
- For each original document, we offer a novel rendition (as an HTML page), and
  a JSON representation.
- There is also a Markdown version of each document offered in the
  [`hypered/iterata-md`](https://github.com/hypered/iterata-md) Git repository.
- There is also the original version of each document offered in the
  [`hypered/iterata-src`](https://github.com/hypered/iterata-src) Git repository.
- The most important feature is not yet visible per se but enables the above
  new representations: each document is parsed and a structured representation
  is recovered.

# 2023-02-14

This changelog entry is about the first version of Refli where a useful feature
is added: a gross/net salary computation. It is currently very limited (it
applies only to an employee with a single revenue, no children, etc).

- [refli.be](https://refli.be) now offers a form on its homepage for a (simple)
  salary computation.
- The URL for the computation result can be manually edited to change the
  computation input (i.e. the form is really just a convenience).
- URL variants (by appending `/txt` and `/json`) exist to return results as
  text or JSON.
- The Refli backend is written in Haskell. The code, unlike the Markdown
  documentation, is closed source.
- Some pages are now generated by the backend (i.e. they are now longer
  generated from Markdown) and as such don't have a link to their source on
  GitHub.

# 2022-12-17

This changelog entry is about the initial version of Refli, as visible on
[refli.be](https://refli.be). The [Git
repository](https://github.com/hypered/refli.be) has more content which is not
written down here.

- [refli.be](https://refli.be) is a static site made of a few pages, mainly
  written in French:
  - The [homepage](/).
  - An ["about"](/pages/fr/about.md) page.
  - This ["changelog"](/pages/changelog.md) page.
  - A ["contact"](/pages/fr/contact.md) page.
  - A (currently empty) ["disclaimer"](/pages/fr/disclaimer.md) page.
- It is deployed on DigitalOcean as an Nginx Nix configuration. That
  configuration is used in a NixOS VM image which is not part of Refli itself.
- The pages are written using Markdown, and rendered to HTML using Pandoc. They
  use the Hypered [design system](https://github.com/hypered/design)
  (which is currently not yet a real design system, nor very mature).
- Each rendered page has a link to its source Markdown file on GitHub.
