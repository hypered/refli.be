Refli is dedicated to the exploration of payroll calculation in Belgium. Our
goal is to make the rules of payroll calculation more accessible by providing a
unified platform that integrates documentation, data and calculation tools.

We are designing this unique tool to meet the needs of a wide range of users,
from professionals specializing in payroll or software development, to students
and citizens who want to understand and apply these rules.

We believe that it is possible to clarify concepts that are considered complex,
while maintaining a solid foundation based on Belgian legislation. To this end,
we have developed a layer called Lex Iterata, which reorganizes texts from the
Belgian Official Journal into a more structured, user-friendly format.

We invite professionals and enthusiasts to contribute to the development of
Refli. Your expertise and feedback are essential to enrich and perfect our
platform. If you have any suggestions or would like to collaborate, please do
not hesitate to [contact us](/pages/en/contact.md).
