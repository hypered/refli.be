Exploring how Belgian compensations are computed.


# Withholding tax

The withholding tax (or "précompte professionnel" in French) is described in
the Belgian official journal. The relevant parts are listed on the [FPS
Finance] website (although only in Dutch and French).

In particular there are three links. The data of the second one, [Barèmes 1er
janvier 2021], are available in source code form in
[`withholding-tax/scales.hs`](withholding-tax/scales.hs).
